Dear All,

This example is in response to a question on StackOverflow:

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7780753/imessage-style-receding-keyboard-in-an-ios-app

This is not really apart of BindleKit, however I am considering writing a wrapper class to
implement the sliding keyboard in a resuable manner.  If I write the wrapper class, it will
be added to BindleKit and this example servese as my reminder to write it.
